# **🎓 Chance of Admission Prediction for Higher Studies**


*A machine learning model to predict the probability of admission into higher studies.*

## 🌟 **Overview**
This project implements a **Chance of Admission Prediction model** using **Supervised Machine Learning** techniques. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a student getting admitted into a graduate program based on academic and profile-related factors.

## 🎯 **Key Features**
✅ **Predicts Admission Chances** – Estimates probability based on academic scores and other factors.  
✅ **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing** – Handles missing values, scaling, and categorical encoding.  
✅ **Multiple ML Models** – Compares Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
✅ **Performance Evaluation** – Uses metrics like RMSE, R² Score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  
✅ **Jupyter Notebook Implementation** – Step-by-step execution for easy understanding.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
🔹 **Programming Language:** Python  
🔹 **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
🔹 **Model Type:** Regression (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
🔹 **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
