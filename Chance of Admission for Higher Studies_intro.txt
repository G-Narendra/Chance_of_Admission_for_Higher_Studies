Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is titled "Admission Chance," sourced from a GitHub repository. It contains information about 400 applicants to graduate programs. The dataset includes the following columns:

Serial No: A unique identifier for each applicant.
GRE Score: The applicant's GRE test score.
TOEFL Score: The applicant's TOEFL test score.
University Rating: A rating of the university (1 to 5).
SOP: Statement of Purpose strength (1.0 to 5.0).
LOR: Letter of Recommendation strength (1.0 to 5.0).
CGPA: Undergraduate GPA (on a scale of 10).
Research: Whether the applicant has research experience (0 or 1).
Chance of Admit: The likelihood of the applicant being admitted (0.0 to 1.0).
Project Description
The project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate the "Chance of Admit" for applicants based on their academic and profile features. This involves the following steps:

Data Import and Exploration: Load the dataset and perform initial data inspection.
Data Preprocessing: Define the target variable y (Chance of Admit) and features X (all other relevant columns).
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
Model Selection and Training: Use linear regression to train the model on the training data.
Model Prediction: Predict the Chance of Admit for the test data.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
This project provides insights into how different factors influence admission chances and helps in making data-driven predictions for future applicants.
